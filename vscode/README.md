## About

*Softie* is a soft-colored theme with a dark tone, especially designed for text editors. It has a similar appearance to pastel colors but with more vibrant, beautiful, and pleasant shades.

Why should you use Softie for your text editor? Well, as mentioned before, this is a dark theme, which is more pleasant to the eyes than a white or light background. Moreover, the other colors in the palette are prominent enough to provide clear syntax highlighting without being too distracting.

## Credits

The theme has been inspired by other popular themes for text editors. Here are the references:

- [Electron: Onedark theme](https://github.com/topics/one-dark)
- [NvChad: Aquarium theme](https://nvchad.com/themes/themelist)
