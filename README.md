## About

*Softie* is a soft-colored theme with a dark tone, especially designed for text editors. It has a similar appearance to pastel colors but with more vibrant, beautiful, and pleasant shades.

Why should you use Softie for your text editor? Well, as mentioned before, this is a dark theme, which is more pleasant to the eyes than a white or light background. Moreover, the other colors in the palette are prominent enough to provide clear syntax highlighting without being too distracting.

In my other account, I have some additional color themes for the Eclipse 'Dev-Style' plugin, which are some based on popular themes on the internet, and others that are my own creations. If you have any theme that you would like to be implemented for this plugin, simply contact me or open an issue in that repository.
